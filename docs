# PRD: Web-Based Financial Tracker

## TL;DR
People who already track their finances in spreadsheets are doing the *right work* with the *wrong tool*. This product turns a disciplined Excel-based financial tracker (Kira Kira v2) into a structured, automated, insight-driven web app that helps users **plan, track, and understand their finances with less effort and more clarity**.

## Problem Statement

Financially disciplined users often outgrow Excel.

While spreadsheets are flexible, they:
- Require heavy manual upkeep
- Break easily as data grows
- Prioritize visual layout over data structure
- Make year-over-year and category-level analysis painful

Users want to:
- Plan spending vs reality
- Track multiple credit cards across months and years
- Understand *where* money actually goes
- Reduce time spent maintaining tools

**Core problem:** Users spend more effort maintaining spreadsheets than learning from their financial data.

## Narrative (Executive Story)

This product is built for users who already care about their money.

They track income, spending, and credit cards diligently—but every month feels like spreadsheet maintenance instead of insight generation.

The web tracker respects existing discipline and removes friction:
- No duplicated tables
- No broken formulas
- No manual rollups

Instead, it quietly transforms inputs into clarity:
- Where money goes
- What changed this month
- What patterns are emerging year over year

This is not a beginner budgeting app. It is a **financial command center** for serious users.
